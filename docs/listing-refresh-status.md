# ChatGPT listing refresh — where we are

**Pick-up-here document.** Written 2026-09-16 at the end of a long working session. It records
state and decisions, not procedure: the runbook is [`openai-submission.md`](./openai-submission.md)
(§10 tracks the rejection findings, §11 the widget-caching trap) and the canonical copy is
[`openai-listing-copy.md`](./openai-listing-copy.md). **Update this file whenever the state
changes**; a status doc that has gone stale is worse than none, as §11 records at length.

## Status at a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| Live in the directory | **v1.0.0**, approved 2026-08-14 |
| Last submission | **v2.0.0, REJECTED 2026-08-30** — "one or more test cases did not produce correct results" |
| The v2 draft | **still editable in the portal** (read back 2026-09-16). This is what resubmits unless changed |
| Resubmission | **not filed.** Blocked on one thing: nobody has run the 5+3 test cases in ChatGPT |
| Server | `mcp-service-00196-jcc` (2026-09-16). Carries `e2365df` — quiz summary + Learnosity ✓ |
| Console | `console-00618-4gk` (2026-09-16), carries the catalog-search work |

---

## The critical path

Submitting as **v2.1.0**, rescanned in the still-editable v2 draft.

1. ~~**Deploy `e2365df`**~~ — **done 2026-09-16**, revision `mcp-service-00196-jcc`. Verified
   live: a 3-question quiz now returns all three questions with ✓ answer keys. The widget hash
   moved to **`2656b7bd`** as expected, so every client's cached build is one behind again.
2. ~~**Build the plugin ZIP**~~ — **done 2026-09-17**, `npm run package` in
   `graffiticode-skills`. The build refuses an uncommitted or stale ref, so it always describes
   a pushed commit. Record the artifact SHA-256 in `openai-submission.md` §2.
3. **Refresh §6's 5+3 test cases** so they name the current languages and verified outcomes.
   They were written before L0180 and L0181 existed, and a reviewer follows them literally.
   Positive case 1 also still describes the retired `list_languages → get_language_info` path.
   *Mine to draft.*
4. **Run the 5+3 by hand in ChatGPT**, on a build whose hash you have checked. This is the
   whole ballgame: the rejection said test cases failed, and two of the five never reached the
   server at all. *Yours — no agent can do it.*
5. **Rescan and resubmit.** Open the v2 draft, set 2.1.0, upload the ZIP, **run Scan Tools**,
   then freeze and submit. *Yours.*

**Step 5's scan is what surfaces the widget, and nothing else does.** The v2 draft's metadata
was captured on 2026-08-18, before OpenAI clients got widget metadata at all (2026-08-31, with
the mount fixes of 09-11 and 09-15). Resubmitting without rescanning ships the August contract
under a new number. Confirm in the scan result that the widget marker lands on `render_item`
and `get_item` only, and that the imported UI resource URI is a `widget-mcp.<hash>.html` one —
a retired `widget-oai`/`form-widget` pointer would make every `resources/read` in review throw
`Resource retired` (`src/server.ts:928`).

Everything else — latency, routing, the widget race, the catalog search — is done and verified.

## What is snapshot and what is live (researched 2026-09-17, OpenAI primary docs)

This is the frame for every "will it update automatically" question, and the answer is usually
no.

| | Runtime source | Refreshes without resubmitting? |
|---|---|---|
| Tool **calls**, **results**, **UI resources** (widget HTML, per-language bundles) | live server | **Yes** — always live |
| Tool **definitions** (name, description, schemas, annotations) | last accepted scan | Docs say yes via continuous review; **OpenAI staff said no** on 2026-07-23. Contradictory — do not rely on it |
| **`_meta`**, linked UI resource metadata, **CSP** | submission snapshot | **No** |
| Server **`instructions`** | undocumented | Imported at scan; absent from the refresh sentence. **Assume snapshot** |
| **Skills** (ZIP *or* MCP-served) | submission snapshot | **No.** Stated three times: "ChatGPT and Codex do not fetch them from your MCP server at runtime" |
| Listing copy (`interface.*`) | submission snapshot | **No** |
| Arbitrary non-UI **resources** (`graffiticode://skills/<id>`) | undocumented | Probably never read by ChatGPT at all — "Plugins primarily use tools" |

Three consequences worth holding onto:

- **`skills/list` (SEP-2640) would not buy dynamic skills.** It buys single-sourcing — no ZIP to
  keep in sync — and nothing else. That is why the refresh ships a built ZIP instead.
- **Our MCP resources deliver nothing to ChatGPT.** The runtime GitHub discovery that makes a
  new skill live in ~3.5 minutes serves Claude and any other resource-reading client; ChatGPT
  sees the snapshot taken at Scan Tools.
- **The language catalog may be frozen for ChatGPT.** `buildServerInstructions(getCachedFullCatalog())`
  rebuilds it into `instructions` on every `initialize` — a live mechanism whose output the
  portal appears to snapshot. If so, ChatGPT has been routing against the catalog as of
  submission day, while `list_languages` would have returned the current one all along. **Test
  it in the ChatGPT pass**: ask for a language added since 2026-08-18 and see whether it routes.
  If it does not, the fix is to shrink `instructions` to a stable pointer and let the tool
  result carry the catalog — at the cost of the ~14s discovery call removed on 2026-09-01.

---

## Decisions owed

1. **Subtitle.** Draft holds `Assessments, diagrams and more` (30/30). Proposed:
   `Quizzes, spreadsheets, charts` (29/30) — the live one spends its characters on the two
   words nobody searches. Rationale in `openai-listing-copy.md`.
2. **Description.** Adopt the three-paragraph draft that adds L0177/L0178, or keep v2's
   two-paragraph text and leave both integration languages invisible.
3. **Starter prompt 1.** Its recorded output claimed `$#,##0.00` currency formatting, which was
   L0166's behaviour; L0179 emits raw numbers. Accept the plain invoice, or ask for formatting
   in the prompt and re-verify. **Do not resubmit with the stale expectation in the record.**
4. **L0159.** It is `hidden`, so `matching game` / `memory game` cannot be advertised or routed
   to. Unhide it and both words go into the copy and the catalog; leave it and they stay out.

## App vs plugin, and how to test the refresh

Source: advice from ChatGPT on 2026-09-17, pasted into a working session, and **since checked
against OpenAI's primary docs** — see the snapshot-vs-live section above, which supersedes this
one wherever they disagree. The two-layer account below held up; the package format is the
Agent Plugins 1.0.0 standard (`plugin.json` + `skills/<id>/SKILL.md`), and the plugin's
`interface` block is the listing itself. **What did not hold up:** GitHub marketplace import is
workspace-private distribution, *not* a route into the public directory — public submission is
still a ZIP upload at the portal. The testing advice below is unverified but sound, and the
corrections marked in it still stand.

### The two layers

According to that advice, OpenAI uses the two words for different layers:

| | App | Plugin |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | The connection to Graffiticode (our MCP server) | The package users install and invoke |
| Provides tools | Yes | Through an app it includes |
| Carries skills/instructions | No | Yes |
| Can contain several apps | No | Yes |
| Discovery surface | None of its own; sits underneath | **Plugin Directory** |

- **The Plugin Directory is said to be the main discovery surface since 2026-07-09.** A plugin
  bundles apps, skills and app templates. Apps still exist, as the integration layer underneath.
- **What this means for us:** it's the same structure we already submit as
  "app-plus-skills" (runbook §2). The MCP server is the app. The `graffiticode-skills` ZIP is
  the behavioural layer: when to call Graffiticode, which language to pick, how to read the
  result.
- **Why ChatGPT doesn't reliably use a registered server:** the app gives ChatGPT the
  *capability*, and the skill gives it the *workflow*. When the server is connected but never
  gets called, look at the skills and `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS` before the tools.
- **Corrections to the advice:** its example diagram listed `compile` and `create artifact`
  tools. Neither exists. The real set is the seven tools in `CLAUDE.md`.

### What to test: discovery, then routing, then execution

| Layer | Question | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery | Does ChatGPT see that Graffiticode is relevant, **without being told**? | "Create a polished bar chart showing monthly sales using sample data." |
| Routing | Does it pick the right language? | chart → L0173, spreadsheet → L0179, concept web → L0169, quiz → L0180 |
| Execution | Does the item actually work? | reaches `ready`, the widget mounts, the link opens |

**Prompt categories** (aim for 15–20 prompts across them):

1. **Obvious fit, no mention of Graffiticode.** Bar chart, household budget spreadsheet, water
   cycle concept map, 5-question photosynthesis quiz. This is the harder test and the more
   valuable one.
2. **Explicit invocation.** The same asks, phrased as `@Graffiticode …` or "Use Graffiticode
   to …".
3. **Several languages could apply.** Spreadsheet vs chart, concept web vs assessment, and
   Learnosity only when the user names it (the vendor gate; see `npm run eval:routing`).
   - The advice also listed "Mystic Wonk/L0182". This repo's docs don't record it. Confirm it's
     in the catalog before writing a case for it.
   - The advice said spreadsheet → L0166. **L0166 was deprecated on 2026-08-26. Use L0179.**
4. **Follow-ups that should edit, not restart.** "Make the bars horizontal", "Add March",
   "Make question 3 harder", "Add another category to the budget". Expect `update_item` on the
   existing `item_id`, not a new `create_item`.
5. **Boundary cases: activation vs non-activation.**
   - Should **not** call Graffiticode: "What's a bar chart?", "Give me five ideas for a quiz",
     "Show me how to make a spreadsheet in Excel".
   - **Should** call it: "Create the quiz", "Make the spreadsheet for me".

   These are strong candidates for the 3 negative test cases in §6. They are more realistic than
   "Book me a flight to Tokyo".

**Four configurations**, each run in a **fresh chat**:

- **A.** Plugin not installed (baseline: what ChatGPT does on its own)
- **B.** Plugin installed, no `@` mention (discovery: the most informative one)
- **C.** Plugin installed, with `@Graffiticode` (explicit routing)
- **D.** A fresh conversation for every important case; never lean on earlier context

**Score each run on five things, not a single pass/fail:** activation, non-activation,
language selection, compilation, UX. Also record the chain
*prompt → ChatGPT's interpretation → language → generated item → render*, so a bad result
points to the step that failed.

**Permissions.**
- Test read-only calls and consequential calls separately. OpenAI reportedly has per-app
  permission controls (from "ask before actions" to allowing low-risk actions).
- **Correction to the advice:** we have no publish/share/send tool. Our one consequential call
  is `update_item` (`destructiveHint: true`, `src/tools.ts`).
- The test that matters: does ChatGPT ask for confirmation before `update_item` and not before
  `render_item` / `get_spec` / `list_languages`?

**Don't use `list_languages` as an acceptance test.** It's a good MCP diagnostic and a poor
product test, which matches the 2026-09-01 change to call `create_item` directly. §6 positive
case 1 still describes the old `list_languages → get_language_info` path. Fix it in step 2 of
the critical path.

**Best two end-to-end smoke tests:**
- "Create a polished bar chart using sample data."
- "Make a 5-question multiple-choice quiz on the water cycle."

They exercise two very different languages, and a reviewer understands both without knowing
anything about Graffiticode. Run each with and without `@Graffiticode`.

### How to install the development version (unverified)

- **Public listing:** Plugins → search "Graffiticode" → Install plugin → Connect → new chat
  → `@Graffiticode`. That tests v1.0.0, **not** the refresh.
- **Pre-release (recommended):** use a workspace-private plugin. Workspace settings →
  Plugins → Add → Import marketplace → GitHub repository. Set Graffiticode to *Available*,
  install it yourself, and use **Sync now** after each change instead of waiting for the daily
  sync.
  - This tests the exact manifest + skill + app combination you're about to submit.
  - **Unknown:** whether we have a GitHub plugin repo in the shape this route expects. The skills
    repo is not obviously one.

### Web vs desktop vs mobile

- **Web first.** It's the main acceptance environment and the easiest place to debug, because
  it takes the desktop app's version and cache state out of the picture.
- **Desktop** is a regression pass. If something works on web and fails on desktop, suspect
  client caching before the server; see "two clients, two caches" below.
- **Mobile:** smoke-test the 2–3 key workflows.
- **This does not relax the §5 gate.** The reviewer tests web **and** mobile, so both still need
  a full 5+3 run and a widget render a person has watched.

## Verified, with dates

Nothing here should be re-derived. Everything else should be treated as unknown.

| What | When | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Starter prompt routing, 3 runs each | 2026-09-15 | L0179 / L0169 / L0176, 3/3 each; prompts 1–2 route with zero discovery calls |
| Starter prompt generation | 2026-09-15 | 13.0s / 9.7s / 7.4s, contents checked field by field |
| Full routing eval | 2026-09-15 | 14 cases × 3 runs + 10 catalog invariants, all green |
| Catalog search after the console deploy | 2026-09-16 | `invoice`→L0179, `flashcards`→L0181, `quiz`→L0180, `do my laundry`→(none) |
| Widget render on a NAMED build | 2026-09-16 02:45 / 02:49 UTC | L0173 chart and L0169 concept web drew in Codex on `ae93cbff` |
| ChatGPT served the current build | 2026-09-16 16:21 UTC | read the legacy URI, which maps to current — see below |
| Demo sequence end to end | 2026-09-16 | quiz 13.6s → add cloze ~20s → flashcards via `get_spec` ~25-30s |
| Quiz summary + answer key, in production | 2026-09-16, rev `00196` | 3 questions listed, each with its ✓ correct option |

**The rule that makes those dates meaningful:** a render proves nothing unless you know which
build the client loaded. Check before concluding anything:

```bash
gcloud logging read 'resource.labels.service_name="mcp-service" AND textPayload:"resources/read"' \
  --project graffiticode-app --freshness=2h --format="value(timestamp,textPayload)"
```

Current build as of this writing: **`2656b7bd`** (revision `mcp-service-00196-jcc`). It moves on
every deploy that touches `src/widget/` or `src/item-content.ts`.

## Not verified

- **No person has watched a widget render in ChatGPT itself.** Codex, yes. ChatGPT, never — on
  any build, including the ones it was demonstrably served.
- **The multi-question quiz shape in the widget.** A five-question quiz is
  `data.activity.items[]`, a different shape from the single item our mount test covers. That
  exact distinction was broken in the summary extractor until 2026-09-16. Dry-run before filming
  or demoing.
- **Which copy the LIVE v1.0.0 listing shows.** The 2026-09-16 read-back was the v2 draft.
  Whether any v2 copy reached the published listing through post-approval editing is unanswered.
- **L0180 and L0181 rendering in any OpenAI host.**

---

## What we learned that is not obvious

**Clients mount the widget build they cached, not the one we serve.** The resource URI is
content-hashed so new content cannot be served from a cache keyed on a stable URI — but the URI
itself arrives in `tools/list`, and these clients cache that. One read a build from five days
earlier seventy seconds after a fresh `tools/list`. Two diagnoses were wrong before this was
understood. Full account in §11.

**The legacy URI is a working escape hatch.** ChatGPT's runtime asks for
`ui://graffiticode/claude-form-widget.html`, from before content hashing existed, and
`src/widget/index.ts:52` maps it to the **current** widget. So ChatGPT gets today's build
despite an ancient cached id — which is why the caching trap is survivable at all. Do not remove
that shim.

**OpenAI scans the server daily at 14:21 UTC**, on the minute, reading `tools/list` and the
widget resource, and it does take the current URI. It is not what refreshes what a user's
client mounts.

**One product, two clients, two caches.** `codex-mcp-client` (local, refreshed on launch) and
`openai-mcp (Codex)` (OpenAI's cloud side, its own snapshot) loaded different builds ninety
seconds apart in the same session. That alone can produce a "renders on mobile, card on desktop"
split with no code difference — which is what the 2026-09-11 finding probably was.

**Codex flips its capability declaration between launches** of the same binary, so it lands on
the `mcp-apps` route or the `openai` route at random. Both must work; this is why the transport
is raced rather than guessed.

**Empty summaries hide behind widgets.** Three languages returned a title and a link and nothing
else — L0169, L0180 multi-question, and every Learnosity answer key — because a widget host
mounts the real component and never reads the summary. The only clients that can see the bug are
the ones we were not watching. Assume the next one is broken too until a payload is checked.

**Evals go stale silently.** Two routing cases asserted a catalog that no longer existed and
were only caught because unrelated work forced a full run.

## The 90-second screencast (for the listing)

Four shots, all dry-run against production on 2026-09-16.

1. **"Make a 5-question multiple-choice quiz on the water cycle."** (~14s) — it mounts, and
   **you answer a question on camera and it scores you.** That shot is the whole pitch.
2. **"Add a fill-in-the-blank question about condensation."** (~20s) — returns as question 6, a
   text-entry blank accepting "condensation". Refinement is just talking.
3. **"Turn that into a flashcard deck for studying."** (~25-30s) — `get_spec` carries the
   content across languages: 6 cards, each question mapped to its answer. L0181 renders
   natively as of 2026-09-16.
4. **"Open in Graffiticode"** — it persists and it is editable.

Leave out the Learnosity integration recipes (spec prose, bad on video) and anything unverified
on the host you record in. Three generations is ~60s of a 90s video, so trim in post but leave
the progress line visible for a beat — "11s, ~433 tokens written" reads as working rather than
hung. If a `render_item` errors, ask again; one timed out and succeeded on retry.

---

## Where things live

- **Runbook and reviewer materials:** `openai-submission.md` (§10 rejection findings, §11 caching)
- **Canonical copy, per version:** `openai-listing-copy.md` (read-back, proposals, verification)
- **Routing eval:** `npm run eval:routing`, or `-- --only starter` for the three storefront
  prompts. Re-run after touching `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS`, tool descriptions, or the catalog.
- **Catalog search:** lives in the **console** repo (`src/lib/languages.ts`), not this one.
- **Scheduled reminder:** routine `trig_011UsNKpmrBBdVJr8eNBwz3j`. It fired 2026-09-16 14:45 UTC,
  confirmed no `src/` drift, and correctly refused to fake the ChatGPT test rather than invent a
  result. A one-shot; re-arm it with a new `run_once_at` if you want another.
