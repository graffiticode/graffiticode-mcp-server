# OpenAI / ChatGPT app-directory submission runbook

Operational checklist and reviewer materials for submitting the Graffiticode MCP
server to OpenAI's app directory (Apps SDK, `platform.openai.com/plugins`) as a
**With MCP → app-plus-skills** submission.

> **Where we are right now: [`listing-refresh-status.md`](./listing-refresh-status.md)** — the
> pick-up-here document. It holds the critical path, the decisions owed, what is verified and
> what is not. This file is the procedure; that one is the state.

**Status (2026-09-15).** v1.0.0 was **approved 2026-08-14**. v2.0.0 was **rejected
2026-08-30** — "one or more test cases did not produce correct results." No resubmission has
been filed. What changed since the rejection is recorded in §10; read it before reusing any
checklist below, because two things the reviewer sees are different now (ChatGPT gets a
widget, and the expected tool-call path is shorter).

- **Publisher:** Artcompiler (business identity verification).
- **MCP endpoint:** `https://mcp.graffiticode.org/mcp` (Streamable HTTP).
- **UI: OpenAI clients now get the native inline widget** (2026-08-31 `dd8f67e`, corrected
  2026-09-11 `365e406`). `render_item` and `get_item` carry it; `create_item`/`update_item` do
  not (they return `generating`). **Which route an OpenAI client takes depends on what it
  declares, not on its name alone** (`widgetRouteFor` in `src/tools.ts`):
  - declares `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` → **`mcp-apps`**, the same ext-apps contract Claude
    gets. Codex v0.153.4 declares `[io.modelcontextprotocol/ui, openai/form]` and lands here.
  - does not declare it → **`openai`**, `_meta["openai/outputTemplate"]` and the Skybridge
    contract, admitted on the name allow-list `/openai|chatgpt|codex/i`.

  Declaring is **necessary but not sufficient**: `web-sandbox`-style clients declare the
  extension too and still get text, pinned by `tools-contract.test.ts`. Note the route is
  nearly cosmetic — the OpenAI key set is additive rather than route-exclusive, so the metadata
  every observed client receives is byte-identical before and after that change. What actually
  fixed Codex's blank card was the **transport**: `createHost` used to guess
  (`window.openai ? Skybridge : ExtApps`), commit to the guess, and spin forever against a
  global the host never populates. `RacingHost` now asks both and keeps whichever answers
  first. A mount that draws nothing falls back to the content card, and the fallback now says
  so on screen (`f5759be`) instead of only in a console nobody has open.

  **The submission therefore has a UI surface**: the portal imports it at Scan Tools, and UI
  screenshots are in scope. CSP declares `resourceDomains` only (`widgetCsp()` in
  `src/widget/index.ts`) — no `frameDomains` (the OpenAI review flag), no `connectDomains`.
  **Which route ChatGPT's consumer app takes is still unobserved** — production has only ever
  logged `codex-mcp-client` and `openai-mcp`. Check the `[widget] tools/list` log line during
  the review window and record it here.
- **Legal:** privacy `https://mcp.graffiticode.org/privacy`, terms
  `https://mcp.graffiticode.org/terms`, support `support@graffiticode.org`.
- **Listing copy:** [`openai-listing-copy.md`](./openai-listing-copy.md) is the canonical,
  versioned source for every public publisher field (category, tagline, description, starter
  prompts). The portal is **not** the source of truth — change both in the same sitting.

---

## 0. OAuth go/no-go gate (decide BEFORE creating the draft)

> **DECIDED (2026-07-16): v1 is `noauth`-only.** Tools advertise `{ type: "noauth" }`
> only (`TOOL_SECURITY_SCHEMES` in `src/tools.ts`); do **not** configure an OAuth
> connection in the portal. OAuth ships in a later reviewed update once item 2c-vi lands.

The optional OAuth surface is hardened server-side **except** one cross-service item:
the consent page still returns the Google ID token in the `/oauth/callback` **query
string** (see `src/oauth/handlers.ts` `handleCallback`), which can leak into history/logs.
Fixing it needs a coordinated change in the console/auth consent service.

- **If that change has landed:** submit **with OAuth** (optional auth). Provide reviewer
  credentials (below).
- **If not:** submit **v1 as `noauth`-only** — in the portal, do not configure the OAuth
  connection; the tools still advertise `{ type: "noauth" }` and work anonymously (free
  plan). Add OAuth in a later reviewed update. **Never advertise a partially-hardened OAuth
  surface.**

Anonymous write tools are safe to expose (state this to reviewers): they operate only in an
**isolated free-plan session**, expose **no customer account data**, claiming created
content **requires sign-in**, and OAuth (when enabled) associates later work with an account.

---

## 1. Prerequisites (start immediately, in parallel with code)

- [ ] Artcompiler **business identity verification** complete in the Platform Dashboard.
- [ ] Org owner has **`api.apps.write`** (draft/submit) and `api.apps.read`.
- [ ] Production is on the single-instance review config (see §5).

## 2. Plugin package (the ZIP is built, not assembled by hand)

Source: the public `graffiticode/graffiticode-skills` repo (same skills served as MCP
resources). Built with **`npm run package`** there — `scripts/build-plugin.mjs`. Served
skills as of 2026-09-17: **`render`** (broad default-rendering preference — the primary),
**`assessments`**, **`learnosity`**. `forms` is held (`SKILL.md.draft`) and the build excludes
it automatically.

The package is an **Agent Plugins 1.0.0** tree — a generated `plugin.json` at the root plus
`skills/<id>/SKILL.md`. Note the shipped layout is NOT the repo's: skills live at the repo's
top level because the MCP server discovers them there at request time, and the build restages
them. `plugin.json`'s `interface` block **is** the listing (display name, subtitle, long
description, category, starter prompts); it is generated from `plugin.meta.json` in that repo,
whose human-readable counterpart is `openai-listing-copy.md`.

```bash
cd ../graffiticode-skills
npm run package -- --dry-run    # build and hash, write nothing
npm run package                 # dist/graffiticode-plugin-<version>.zip
```

The build is a pure function of one commit: it resolves `--ref` (default `origin/main`) to a
SHA, gates on that ref's own `validate`, and reads every shipped byte out of git rather than
off disk — so an uncommitted edit cannot ship. Output is byte-identical across machines,
timezones and locales, which is what makes the checklist below verifiable at all.

Checklist for the ZIP:
- [ ] Built from a **pushed** commit (the build refuses anything else) and `npm run validate`
      is green.
- [ ] `interface` text matches `openai-listing-copy.md`, and every capability it claims is one
      the current catalog actually serves.
- [ ] `version` matches what the portal draft carries (see the record below).
- [ ] **Record the artifact SHA-256 and the ref it was built from**, so the ZIP the portal
      holds is comparable to the ZIP the repo produces.

| Version | Ref | SHA-256 | Uploaded |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1.0 | `f2c3035` (2026-09-19) | `7c7ae8527b36c6edec9be7ecbcb8372fb518e4c18077b4662d2f2eac0dc4faa2` | not yet |

Rebuild that ref to compare: `npm run package -- --ref 7e4945f --dry-run` prints the same
SHA-256 or the artifact is not what this table claims.

## 3. Domain verification — **DONE**

> **Completed for v1 (approved 2026-08-14). `mcp.graffiticode.org` stays verified across
> versions — do not go chasing this again.** The procedure is kept only in case the host
> changes or the portal asks for re-verification.

OpenAI fetches the token from the **root of the registered host**
(`https://mcp.graffiticode.org/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge`; the `/mcp` path is
ignored). The apex `graffiticode.org` is only relevant if the portal explicitly asks for it
as the Challenge Base URL — confirm in-portal before assuming.

1. In the portal, obtain the challenge token.
2. Set it on the **already-tested image** (do not rebuild from an unverified tree):
   `gcloud run services update mcp-service --update-env-vars=OPENAI_APPS_CHALLENGE_TOKEN=<token>`
3. Verify: `curl https://mcp.graffiticode.org/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge` returns the
   **exact token and nothing else**, `Content-Type: text/plain`, `Cache-Control: no-store`.
4. Click verify in the portal. (The route 404s while the env var is unset.)

## 4. Tool + language facts to confirm at submission time

- Seven tools: `create_item`, `update_item`, `render_item`, `get_item`, `get_spec`,
  `list_languages`, `get_language_info`.
- **Re-confirm language IDs via `list_languages` immediately before submission** and record
  both the semantic language and the current ID in the test cases below (IDs below are
  illustrative — the catalog is dynamic).

---

## 5. Production-readiness gates (before "Submit for Review")

- [ ] Cloud Run **`min-instances=1` and `max-instances=1`** for the review window (the MCP
      transport keeps session state in-memory; multi-instance routing could 404 mid-session).
- [ ] `/health` reachable externally through Cloudflare.
- [ ] Full **5+3 run on ChatGPT web AND mobile** (desktop = extra coverage); fresh plugin
      connection + fresh conversation.
- [ ] **A person has watched the widget mount in ChatGPT web AND mobile**, on all three
      starter prompts. Partly satisfied. On 2026-09-11 an L0173 chart was seen drawing in the
      **ChatGPT mobile app** — the first confirmed OpenAI-host render. The same item fell back
      to the content card in ChatGPT desktop; root-caused 2026-09-15 as a delivery race in the
      Skybridge watch loop (§10) and fixed. **On 2026-09-16 at 02:45 UTC a person watched an
      L0173 chart render quickly in Codex on the CURRENT build** — the `resources/read` line
      names `ae93cbff`, so this is the first confirmed render of the fixed widget in a real
      host, on the same Skybridge path ChatGPT uses. Not yet confirmed in ChatGPT itself, whose
      cloud side was still reading the 09-11 build ninety seconds earlier (§11). Since the
      reviewer tests both surfaces, this gate is not met until ChatGPT is seen on a current
      build.
      jsdom is not a substitute — it cannot render L0173 at all (ECharts needs a canvas it
      lacks). **Record the widget hash that client read** (§11) — a render proves nothing about
      the current build unless the `[widget] resources/read` line names it.
- [ ] A **"Generating…" card is expected now, and is not a defect.** It carries a live
      progress line (elapsed + tokens written) and is replaced in place when the item is
      ready. What must NOT appear is a stack of them: `render_item` gives ChatGPT the
      terminal's 15s leash rather than Claude's 8s for exactly this reason (`src/tools.ts`,
      `TERMINAL_POLL_DEADLINE_MS`). Count the cards on a slow generation.
- [ ] Claude regression smoke (native widget still renders).
- [ ] If OAuth: connect end-to-end using the **exact redirect URI ChatGPT registers**.

## 6. Test cases — exactly 5 positive + 3 negative (OpenAI requires this count)

**Rewritten 2026-09-17. Every positive was executed against production that day** (server
`mcp-service-00197-nf8`, console carrying the scope-gate fix) and the recorded outcome is what
came back, not what we expect. Re-verify before submitting if either has been redeployed since.

Expected creation path: **`create_item → render_item`**. `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS` carries the
language catalog inline and tells the model to call `create_item` DIRECTLY for a clear request,
because `list_languages` + `get_language_info` cost ~14s before any work starts (changed
2026-09-01, `7a88c67`). Discovery calls remain correct for an unclear request. **Do not describe
the old four-call path to a reviewer** — they would read its absence as a failure.

**Tell the reviewer to ask for the render.** `create_item` returns `status:"generating"` and the
tool result asks the model to follow up with `render_item`; most hosts do so unprompted, but a
ChatGPT plugin install on 2026-09-17 stopped after `create_item` and only rendered when the user
said "render it here". A test case that depends on the model volunteering that call will fail
for reasons unrelated to the platform, so each case below names the follow-up explicitly.

Generation is asynchronous: **the first `render_item` may return `generating`** — that is
expected. Reviewer instruction: *if `render_item` returns `generating`, wait and call
`render_item(item_id)` again; it returns progress (elapsed seconds and tokens written) each
time.* Measured create→ready on 2026-09-17: **24.6s** (L0180 five-question quiz), **14.1s**
(L0179 budget), **11.3s** (L0176 Learnosity pair), **11.0s** (L0173 chart), **9.5s** (an
`update_item` refine), **11.9s** (L0181 from a spec). Larger items are much slower — a
15,000-token L0179 sheet took 149s on 2026-08-31 — so keep the "allow up to ~3 minutes"
instruction rather than promising a typical figure.

**What a finished result looks like:** a compact text summary carrying the item's contents and an
"Open in Graffiticode" markdown link, in both `content` and `structuredContent`, **plus the
inline widget on hosts that mount one**. State it in that order. The summary is the guaranteed
deliverable and the widget is additive — a reviewer told to expect a rendered component, who then
sees a correct text card, reads a working product as broken. Since 2026-09-17 the summary keeps
the item's contents unless the client DECLARED the MCP-Apps UI extension, because a name-only
match previously told the model "the item is already rendered above" on a host that mounted
nothing, leaving the user with a claim and an empty screen.

### Positive (must succeed)

1. **Quiz — general, ungated.** Prompt: *"Create a 5-question multiple-choice quiz on the water
   cycle."* then *"Render it."* Expect `create_item` → `render_item`, `status:"ready"`, a view
   link, and a summary listing five questions with the correct option marked. **Must route to
   the general assessment language (L0180), NOT a vendor-gated Learnosity language** — this is
   the positive half of the vendor gate and is guarded by `npm run eval:routing`.
   *Verified 2026-09-17: L0180, ready in 24.6s, five `choice` items with scored options. On
   2026-09-18 the same case **rendered as an inline interactive quiz in ChatGPT**, unprompted —
   so expect the component, with the summary beneath it, not a link alone.*

2. **Spreadsheet with formulas.** Prompt: *"Create an invoice with line items, quantity, unit
   price, a line total per row, and a grand total, formatted as currency."* (120 chars — this is
   also starter prompt 1) then *"Render it."* Expect L0179, `ready`, a view link.
   *Verified 2026-09-17: per-row `=B2*C2`, `=SUM(D2:D4)` grand total, and `format "$0.00"` on the
   money columns.* **The formatting clause is load-bearing** — the same prompt without it returns
   unformatted numbers, which is what made the old recorded expectation wrong for eight months.
   *2026-09-18 in ChatGPT: the grid mounted inline (`boot` → `mounted`, no `dump`), and
   create→ready took **91 seconds** across ten `render_item` polls the client made unprompted.*
   **Quote that figure, not the 14.1s elsewhere in this file** — that one is the four-row budget
   sheet. This prompt asks for per-row formulas, a grand total and formatting, and it is the
   slowest of the five. It is also why the "allow up to ~3 minutes" instruction above stays.

3. **Vendor-gated language, correctly requested.** Prompt: *"Create a Learnosity water cycle
   assessment: one multiple-choice and one fill-in-the-blank, answers marked."* then *"Render
   it."* Expect L0176 — the gate permits it because the user named Learnosity — `ready`, and
   **a content card, not an interactive component**: both questions with the multiple-choice
   answer marked ✓, the fill-in-the-blank's sentence with the blank shown as `_____` and its
   accepted answer marked ✓, the note "Interactive preview unavailable — open it to use the
   item", and an "Open the Learnosity assessment" link.
   *Verified 2026-09-17: L0176, ready in 11.3s.*
   **Tell the reviewer this is the intended result.** A Learnosity item cannot render inline:
   it is delivered by Learnosity's own hosted Items API, which needs network access the widget's
   CSP deliberately withholds, a signed request, and a whitelisted domain — and the widget runs
   on the host's sandbox origin, not ours. The item renders fully at the linked form view, whose
   domain is whitelisted. Measured 2026-09-18: without a guard the mount produced one empty
   placeholder `<span>` and a blank frame; the renderer now detects that (`blank` beacon) and
   shows the card. Until the same day the card also showed the fill-in-the-blank as its
   instruction alone — no sentence, no answer — because the extractor read `options` and a cloze
   has none; it now reads the `template` and `valid_response`.

4. **Create then refine in place.** Turn 1: *"Create a bar chart of monthly sales for January
   through June using sample data."* then *"Render it."* Turn 2: *"Make the bars horizontal."*
   Expect `create_item` → `render_item`, then `update_item` → `render_item` on the **same
   `item_id`**, with the change applied. This exercises the conversation-history round trip.
   *Verified 2026-09-17: L0173 ready in 11.0s; the refine returned the same item id in 9.5s.*

5. **Cross-language via `get_spec`.** Turn 1: create the quiz from case 1. Turn 2: *"Turn that
   into a flashcard deck for studying."* Expect `get_spec(item_id)` → `create_item(flashcard
   language, spec text)` → `render_item`: a **flashcard deck (L0181)** whose cards carry each
   question on the front and its answer on the back — NOT another quiz.
   *Verified 2026-09-17: L0181 in 11.9s, `cards [["What is the water cycle primarily powered
   by?" "The Sun"] …]`.* **This case regressed until 2026-09-17** — the scope gate classified on
   the pasted spec rather than the instruction and rerouted L0181 → L0180, returning a quiz to
   someone who asked for flashcards. Re-run it after any change to the console's
   `language-router.ts` or to `get_spec`'s output.

### Negative (must be safely refused / redirected)

1. **A question, not a request to build.** Prompt: *"What's a bar chart?"* Expect a plain answer
   in chat and **no tool call** — Graffiticode authors artifacts; it is not a search path for
   definitions. (The companion positive is "Create the chart", which must call the tool.)

2. **Out of catalog.** Prompt: *"Book me a flight to Tokyo next Tuesday."* Expect the assistant
   to say what Graffiticode does and decline; it must **not** force an unrelated language.
   *Verified 2026-09-17 via `npm run eval:scope-gate` in the console repo: refused, "no dialect
   handles external service integrations or travel bookings".*

3. **Raw cross-language handle.** Prompt: paste an `item_id` (or a raw `src`/AST blob) and ask to
   recreate it in another language. Expect a refusal that redirects to `get_spec` as the
   sanctioned bridge — the handler returns that guidance verbatim rather than guessing
   (`src/tools.ts`). Item ids are opaque and language-private artifacts do not cross languages.


### Tool-annotation notes (for the reviewer)

- `create_item`: `readOnlyHint:false`, `destructiveHint:false`, `openWorldHint:true`.
  Created items are publicly viewable via their `view_url` (hence open-world); creation
  destroys nothing.
- `update_item`: `readOnlyHint:false`, `destructiveHint:**true**`, `openWorldHint:true`.
  It **replaces the item's content in place**; the platform's revert is not exposed through
  MCP and the ChatGPT flow is anonymous, so a user cannot practically restore prior content
  through this surface — marked destructive accordingly. (Will flip to non-destructive in a
  reviewed update once revert is surfaced via MCP.)
- Retrieval/discovery tools (`render_item`, `get_item`, `get_spec`, `list_languages`,
  `get_language_info`): `readOnlyHint:true`.

## 7. Reviewer OAuth instructions (only if submitting with OAuth)

- Auth is **optional**; anonymous free-plan use exercises every tool without linking.
- To test authenticated flow: connect via the standard OAuth 2.1 + PKCE(S256) flow; DCR is
  supported (the connector registers its own client + `https://chatgpt.com/connector/oauth/…`
  redirect). Access tokens are short-lived (55 min) and rotate on refresh; an expired/revoked
  token returns a `401` + `WWW-Authenticate` (and, inside a tool call, a
  `_meta["mcp/www_authenticate"]` challenge) prompting reconnection.
- Provide a reviewer Google account authorized to Graffiticode if account-scoped behavior is
  part of the test set; otherwise the anonymous path suffices.

## 8. Privacy statement (accurate wording)

Tool responses contain **no account access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, passwords, or
debug credentials.** Free-plan responses do include a 24-hour, single-purpose **claim
capability token** in `claim_url` (it transfers anonymous items into an account on first
sign-in and carries no personal data). Logs are metadata-only: never the prompt (only its
length), never raw session UUIDs or bearer tokens (only one-way hashes), never the client IP
(only coarse country/region). OAuth records persist the authorized Google email plus
access/refresh tokens through the auth service.

## 9. Portal submission steps

1. Resolve the **OAuth go/no-go** (§0).
2. Create **With MCP** submission; endpoint `https://mcp.graffiticode.org/mcp`.
3. Configure OAuth + reviewer creds **only if** submitting with OAuth.
4. Domain-verify (§3).
5. **Scan Tools** → confirm **7 tools**, correct input/output schemas, annotations, and
   `securitySchemes`. Confirm the portal imports the **widget on `render_item` only**
   (`openai/outputTemplate`) — `get_item` returns raw src/data for programmatic clients and
   carries no widget metadata. Provide the **smallest CSP the portal
   permits** — ours declares `resourceDomains` only; if the portal offers `frameDomains`, leave
   it EMPTY. Inspect the imported snapshot: the resource URI is content-hashed, so a stale hash
   in the snapshot means the portal cached a previous build.
6. Upload the **plugin ZIP** (§2), built with `npm run package`.
7. Add listing copy, starter prompts, the exact **5+3** tests (§6), availability, release
   notes. **UI screenshots are now in scope** — capture them from ChatGPT, not Claude, and only
   from a render a person has actually watched mount.
8. **Freeze metadata** after the final successful Scan Tools (schema/annotation/description/
   security-scheme changes force a version resubmission).
9. On approval, click **Publish** (apps do not auto-list).

## 10. What changed since the v2.0.0 rejection (2026-08-30)

The rejection said only "one or more test cases did not produce correct results." The
reviewer's 2026-08-29 17:42–18:02 UTC session (they ran `openai-mcp` and `openai-mcp (Codex)`
in alternating pairs) gave three findings. Their status:

| Finding | Status |
|---|---|
| A concept-web request rerouted L0169 → L0166 (deprecated), because the scope gate classified on `get_spec` output pasted under the instruction rather than on the instruction | **Fixed** 2026-08-31 — the classifier splits the ask from source material |
| Of the 5 positive test cases, **only 2 and 4 left any server trace**. Test 1 (flashcards) and test 3 (generic quiz) never reached us — consistent with the generic-quiz routing gap | **Mitigated, not proven.** L0180 (ungated general assessment) registered 2026-09-01, and `eval:routing` now asserts the quiz cases *reach* a language (`expectReachable`) instead of only that they avoid Learnosity — the old assertion was satisfied by calling nothing, so it was green precisely while the gap was open. Logs still cannot distinguish "reviewer skipped" from "ChatGPT declined to call us" |
| Starter prompt 1 was recorded against L0166, deprecated 2026-08-26 — eight days AFTER the v2 submission | **Fixed** 2026-09-15 — re-verified against L0179; see `openai-listing-copy.md` |

Also changed, and material to a reviewer:

- **ChatGPT now gets the widget** (2026-08-31) — see the UI note at the top.
- **Tool results are self-sufficient in `structuredContent`** (2026-09-04) — Claude Code and
  Cowork drop `content[0].text` for any tool with an `outputSchema`, so `summary` is carried in
  both; the item's contents and its link live there.
- **Progress is reported** (2026-09-09) — elapsed seconds and tokens written, in the tool
  result and on the widget's Generating card.
- **Codex renders** (2026-09-11, `45e7138`) — the host transport is raced instead of guessed,
  the mcp-apps route opens to a declaring OpenAI client, a failed native mount says so on
  screen, and widget hosts are no longer told to reprint the item they just drew.
- **Latency** — the 149s outlier traced to `claude-sonnet-5` running adaptive thinking with
  `thinking` omitted; `CODEGEN_EFFORT` exists as an env passthrough but was measured and
  **rejected** (real quality cost, no latency win above noise). Do not set it for a review
  window.

**Still open before resubmitting:**

1. **ChatGPT desktop fell back to the content card** on 2026-09-11 while ChatGPT mobile drew
   the same L0173 chart. **Root-caused 2026-09-15, fixed, and confirmed rendering 2026-09-16
   at 02:45 UTC** — a chart drew quickly in Codex on `ae93cbff`, the fixed build, verified by
   the `resources/read` line rather than by the render alone. ChatGPT itself has still not been
   seen on a current build.

   The cause was a delivery race, not a host capability. Skybridge carries a tool result on
   two globals — `toolOutput` (structuredContent) and `toolResponseMetadata` (`_meta`) — and
   for `render_item` the src/data a native mount needs lives ONLY in the metadata, because the
   structuredContent is compact by design. `SkybridgeHost.connect()` keyed its "is this new?"
   check on `JSON.stringify(r.structuredContent)` alone. A host that sets the output first
   therefore delivered a payload with no render data, the renderer correctly fell back to the
   card, and every later tick that DID carry the metadata was suppressed as a duplicate. The
   card was permanent, no mount was ever attempted, and no bundle fetch existed to explain it.
   Mobile simply won the race. The key now covers `meta`, pinned by
   `tests/widget-skybridge-late-meta.test.ts` (late metadata re-delivers; a stable payload
   still delivers once).

   **For whoever reads the 2026-09-11 commit messages:** `f5759be` says the bundle was
   "fetched with a 200 in both". The logs do not support that. Every Mac-Chrome
   `/widget/lang/*.mjs` fetch that day belongs to an `openai-mcp (Codex)` session — each one
   seconds after that session's own `resources/read` — and the only fetch from a plain
   `openai-mcp` session is the Android one that worked. The ABSENCE of a desktop fetch is what
   identifies the failure as "never attempted a mount" rather than "mounted and drew nothing".

   **What this does NOT rule out:** that the desktop host never populates
   `toolResponseMetadata` at all, in which case the symptom survives the fix. Logs cannot tell
   "late" from "never". If a desktop repro still shows the card, that is the answer — and the
   diagnostic to add next is a visible note for "a native language arrived with no render
   payload", which today falls back silently.
2. **A person has still not watched all three starter prompts render** on either OpenAI
   surface — one chart on mobile is the whole of the evidence. §5 gate.
3. **`list_languages(search: "invoice")` returns nothing**, as does any word the catalog's
   keywords miss. Starter prompt 1 routes correctly anyway (3/3 on the inlined catalog), but a
   reviewer who searches before creating gets an empty result. The keyword index lives in the
   console, not this repo.
4. ~~**L0169's `render_item` summary is empty**~~ — **fixed 2026-09-16.** The extractor
   understood only a finished diagram, whose content sits in each node's `text`; an assessment
   web has blank node text by design, with the answers in `assess.expected` and the options in
   `concepts`, so every string it read was `""` and it returned nothing. The summary now gives
   the topic, instructions, how many nodes are to be filled, and the tray — but not the
   node-to-answer mapping, which is the answer key.
5. The v3 copy gaps in `openai-listing-copy.md` (L0177/L0178 invisible; the `learnosity`
   indexing experiment).

## 11. Widget builds and client caching — the stale-widget trap

**Nothing about widget code can be concluded from what a client renders until you know which
build that client loaded.** Established 2026-09-15/16 over an evening of testing, at the cost
of two wrong diagnoses.

The widget resource URI is content-hashed (`widgetResourceUris()`), so every build gets its own
URI. That defends against a host caching the CONTENT under a stable URI. It does not defend
against a host caching **the URI itself** — and the URI is delivered in `tools/list`, which
OpenAI clients cache aggressively:

| Time (UTC) | Client | Widget URI it read |
|---|---|---|
| 00:22:45 | — | revision `00187-nx4` begins serving `ae93cbff` |
| 00:23–00:24 | `openai-mcp` (ChatGPT) | **no `tools/list`, no `resources/read`** — ran entirely from cache |
| 00:27:16 | `codex-mcp-client` | `2c1856e8` |
| 00:31:11 | diagnostic probe | `ae93cbff` ← still the only client that has ever read it |
| 00:42–00:44 | `openai-mcp` (ChatGPT) | no reads; two L0173 renders showed a link, one L0169 mounted |
| 00:50:13 | `codex-mcp-client` | fresh `tools/list` |
| 00:51:23 | `openai-mcp (Codex)` | `63bb0b17` — **70 seconds after that fresh list**, and a build already in use on 09-11 at 18:24 |

So a client can re-list tools and still read a URI we stopped advertising hours earlier. A
user-initiated reconnect did not force a re-scan; restarting the app produced sessions that
rendered correctly — on `63bb0b17`, a build that predates BOTH the 09-11 transport fix and the
09-15 late-metadata fix. **A render that works is not evidence the current code works.**

**There is a daily scan.** OpenAI reads `tools/list` and the widget resource every day at
**14:21 UTC**, on the minute (observed 09-11 through 09-15). It does take the current URI. But
four consecutive scans saw `2c1856e8` while interactive sessions kept reading `63bb0b17`, so
whatever the scan refreshes, it is not what a user's client mounts.

**The split, caught in one window.** On 2026-09-16, ninety seconds apart in the same Codex
session, two components of the same product loaded two different builds:

| Time (UTC) | Client | Build |
|---|---|---|
| 02:44:52 | `openai-mcp (Codex)` — OpenAI's cloud side | `63bb0b17` (2026-09-11) |
| 02:45:38 | `codex-mcp-client` — the local Codex client | `ae93cbff` (current) |

The local client is the one a restart refreshes; the cloud side keeps its own snapshot and does
not. That is why restarting an app can leave the rendered widget unchanged, and it is the
likeliest explanation of the 09-11 "desktop renders, mobile doesn't" split — two caches, not two
behaviours. **The chart that rendered at 02:45:56 was the first confirmed render of a current
build in any OpenAI host.**

**What this changes:**

1. **Always read the `[widget] resources/read` log line before drawing a conclusion.** It is
   the only place the loaded build is recorded. Two clients with the same name and version can
   be running different builds — which is sufficient, by itself, to produce a "desktop renders,
   mobile doesn't" split with no code difference anywhere. The 09-11 desktop/mobile finding was
   read as a code bug twice before this was understood.
2. **A widget change is not shipped when it deploys.** It is shipped when a host reads the new
   URI. Deploy widget changes well ahead of any review window and confirm with a log line.
3. **For the review itself this is good news**: the daily scan takes the current build, and a
   reviewer connecting fresh gets whatever `tools/list` says at that moment. The trap is one we
   set for ourselves in testing.
4. **Open:** nothing we control is known to force an interactive client to refresh — not a
   deploy, not a reconnect, not the daily scan.

To check what any client is loading:

```bash
gcloud logging read 'resource.labels.service_name="mcp-service" AND textPayload:"resources/read"' \
  --project graffiticode-app --freshness=2h --format="value(timestamp,textPayload)"
```

### Which hosts execute the widget (measured 2026-09-17/18)

**ChatGPT renders it.** Confirmed 2026-09-18 19:19 UTC on `mcp-service-00200-l8w`: a person asked
for a five-question quiz through the workspace plugin and the widget mounted inline, unprompted —
`boot` → `mounted` beacons, the `L0180.mjs` bundle fetched 200, and no `dump` beacon. This is the
first observed inline render on an OpenAI host, and it supersedes every earlier claim in this file
that ChatGPT does not execute the component.

| Host | Reads the resource | Executes it |
|---|---|---|
| `openai-mcp` (ChatGPT) | yes | **yes — mounts** (L0180 quiz and L0179 sheet, both inline) |
| `claude-ai` / `Anthropic/ClaudeAI` | yes | **yes — mounts** |
| `codex-mcp-client` (app) | yes, several URIs at once | yes, sometimes from a cached copy |

**What made it look impossible for two days** was a stale npm package, not the host. A
five-question quiz is `data.activity.items[]`; `@graffiticode/l0180-view@0.1.0` contained the
string "activity" zero times, and every `Form` in the family prints what it cannot parse. So the
component mounted, drew a pretty-printed JSON blob, and reported success. The fix was publishing
`l0180-view@0.2.0` from `l0180@b3be1e8` ("Back-port the activity vocabulary from L0182") — which
also required publishing `@graffiticode/l0180` itself, never before on npm, because the back-port
imports `matching` from it.

**The method mattered as much as the fix.** A widget failing in a chat is silent: the CSP declares
no `connectDomains`, nobody has a devtools console open, and the host reports nothing. A dynamic
`import()` is the one outbound call the CSP already permits, so `/widget/beacon/<stage>.mjs` turns
the access log into a trace — `boot`, `mounted`, `empty`, `error`, `card`, `dump`. Before it, three
separate wrong diagnoses; after it, the answer in one prompt. `dump` in particular is
language-agnostic: any view can meet a shape it was never given, and the content card beats a data
dump every time.

**Still unverified:** that a candidate can ANSWER the inline quiz and see it scored in ChatGPT's
sandbox. L0180 ships its own scorer and needs no network, and `tests/widget-native-mount.test.ts`
pins the click-to-score path in jsdom — but nobody has done it on that host.

### Reconnect before you conclude anything

**A client tests the metadata it connected with, not what is live.** This cost three separate
diagnoses on 2026-09-17 alone:

1. A workspace plugin listed as `assessments` with the wrong description — fixed by re-uploading,
   but the listing only updated on a fresh install.
2. A JSON dump in the chat that "fixed itself" between two runs, with no deploy in between. The
   actual change was the connector being deleted and re-added.
3. A widget build with a beacon that emitted no beacons, because the connector was still serving
   `63bb0b17` while production served `a2a692b8`.

The rule: **after any deploy that changes tool metadata or the widget, delete and re-add the
connector (or use the host's Refresh) before drawing a conclusion.** The tell is the
`[widget] resources/read` line — it names the build the client actually loaded. If that hash is
not the one you just deployed, nothing observed afterwards means anything.

`widgetResourceUris()` content-hashes the URI so new content cannot be served from a cache keyed
on a stale URI, and `handleRequest` serves the CURRENT HTML for any `widget-mcp.<hash>.html` — an
alias that keeps old cached pointers working. Codex exploits both at once: it read four different
URIs within five seconds on 2026-09-18 and got current content for each.

### The link directive: three failed attempts at suppression

`buildLinkDirective` once told a host that had "already rendered" the item not to reproduce its
contents. Every way of deciding who qualifies was measured wrong in one day:

- **By client NAME** — a ChatGPT plugin matched the OpenAI allow-list, mounted nothing, and the
  assistant announced "The interactive Graffiticode quiz is rendered above" over an empty screen.
- **By UI-EXTENSION DECLARATION** — `codex-mcp-client` declares it and is a TERMINAL; it was told
  to stay quiet and printed a bare link, the original failure this directive exists to prevent.
- **CONDITIONAL** ("if it is displayed above…") — the model took the quiet branch anyway and a
  chart arrived as one sentence and a URL.

It is now unconditional: **every client is told to show the item's contents.** Suppression
protected a render not observed on the hosts that matter and charged for it on every call.
Duplication, if a mount starts working, is visible on screen and fixable by a deploy without a
resubmission — the opposite of a silent empty answer.


### Codex flips routes between launches

Same binary, minutes apart, on 2026-09-16:

- 00:49:21 — `codex-mcp-client v0.154.0-alpha.6.2`, `declares_ui_extension=false`, `extensions=[]` → **`openai`** route (Skybridge)
- 00:49:57 — `codex-mcp-client v0.154.0-alpha.6.2`, `declares_ui_extension=true`, `extensions=[io.modelcontextprotocol/ui, openai/elicitation, openai/form]` → **`mcp-apps`** route

Version 0.153.4 declared the extension consistently earlier the same evening. **Any rule keyed
on that declaration is non-deterministic per launch**, so both routes have to work for the same
client — which is the argument for the `RacingHost` transport (`365e406`) being the real fix and
the routing rule being close to cosmetic.
