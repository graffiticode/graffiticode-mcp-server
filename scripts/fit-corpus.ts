// The language–agent fit corpus: what would agents ask for, and do we have it?
//
// Read by scripts/eval-fit.ts. Kept apart from the runner because this file is
// the thing worth arguing about — the prompts ARE the measurement, and they
// should be editable without touching the harness.
//
// This is not a regression suite. eval-routing.ts asserts that specific prompts
// route to specific languages and fails the build when they don't; this asks an
// open question and reports what came back. Nothing here has a required answer,
// which is why `plausible` is a note and never an assertion.
//
// Why it exists: production says ~100% of sessions list the catalog and ~0%
// call a tool. That gap has two explanations — agents can't tell we fit, or we
// genuinely don't — and the funnel can't separate them at three conversions a
// fortnight. This corpus separates them offline, from prompts we choose.
//
// The three buckets carry the whole design:
//
//   covered      We believe a language handles this. A miss is a DISCOVERY bug
//                (bad description, wrong vocabulary, unreachable by search) —
//                the agent had the tool and didn't find it.
//   uncertain    We don't know. A miss here is a CATALOG gap, and the interesting
//                output of the whole exercise: it's a language somebody wanted.
//   out-of-scope We should NOT be picked. These are the controls. Without them a
//                corpus rewards a server that grabs at everything, which is the
//                exact failure eval-routing.ts already guards against.
//
// Prompts are written the way a teacher, instructional designer, or developer
// actually types into a chat: no Graffiticode vocabulary, no language ids, and
// no hint that a tool exists. An agent that only finds us when the user already
// speaks our language has not been measured.
