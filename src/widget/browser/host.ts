/**
 * An adapter that tries BOTH transports and keeps whichever delivers.
 *
 * `window.openai ? Skybridge : ExtApps` was a one-shot guess, and it is wrong for
 * any host that exposes `window.openai` while speaking MCP Apps. Codex is exactly
 * that: it declares `[io.modelcontextprotocol/ui, openai/form]`. Committing to
 * Skybridge there means read() finds no `toolOutput` — not now, not ever — and the
 * watch loop spins for four minutes against a global the host never populates.
 * Nothing renders and nothing says why. That is the blank card.
 *
 * A guess is the wrong shape for this. The host knows which protocol it speaks and
 * answers when spoken to, so ask both and let the answer decide: whichever
 * delivers a tool result first wins, and the loser is dropped. Feature detection
 * still picks the ORDER — `window.openai` first when present — so the common case
 * costs nothing.
