# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

```bash
npm run build         # Compile TS to dist/ (tsc) + bundle the MCP Apps widget (esbuild)
npm run build:widget  # Bundle only the widget (src/widget/browser → dist/widget/widget.bundle.js + per-language dist/widget/lang/<id>.mjs)
npm run clean         # Remove dist/ directory
npm run start         # Run Streamable HTTP server (reads PORT env, defaults to 3001)
npm run gcp:build     # Deploy to Google Cloud Run via Cloud Build
npm run gcp:deploy    # Deploy from source to Cloud Run (mcp-service, us-central1)
npm run gcp:logs      # View Cloud Run logs
```

## Testing / debugging

There is no unit-test suite. Two **eval harnesses** stand in for one; both hit a
live console and cost real API calls, so run them deliberately, not on every edit.

```bash
# Routing eval: does a model pick the RIGHT language for a prompt?
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=… GRAFFITICODE_API_KEY=… npm run eval:routing
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=… GRAFFITICODE_API_KEY=… npm run eval:routing -- --catalog-only

# Cross-language eval: exercises the get_spec adoption path end-to-end
GRAFFITICODE_API_KEY=… npx tsx scripts/eval-cross-language.ts
```

`scripts/eval-routing.ts` puts a real model in front of the real agent-facing surface
(`SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS` + the live `list_languages`/`get_language_info` schemas and handlers,
plus SKILL.md bodies read from a local `../graffiticode-skills` checkout — override with
`GRAFFITICODE_SKILLS_PATH`) and asserts which `language` it passes to a stubbed `create_item`.
Nothing is generated. It exists to lock down a specific regression: prompts that merely
*mention* an assessment ("a 5-question quiz on the water cycle") routing to the **vendor-gated**
Learnosity languages (L0158/L0176), which may only be chosen when the user names Learnosity.
Routing is stochastic, so each case runs N times (`EVAL_RUNS`, default 3) — a 1-of-N failure is
still a regression. **Run this after touching `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS`, tool descriptions, the
language catalog, or the skills repo** — those are exactly the inputs it guards.

For manual testing, the standard tool is the **MCP Inspector** — the official MCP server
testing/debugging app (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`). When the user says "the
inspector" or "the MCP test app", they mean this. Point it at the running server
(`npm run start`, default `http://localhost:3001/mcp`, Streamable HTTP transport) to exercise
tools, resources, and the MCP Apps widget.

## Architecture

This is a thin-router MCP server for Graffiticode. It provides a fixed set of language-agnostic tools that route to language-specific backends. The client specifies which language to use; all language expertise lives in the backend.

### Entry Points

- **`src/server.ts`** - Streamable HTTP transport for hosted deployments. Auth via `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` header, OAuth 2.1 access token, or no auth at all (free-plan path: server forwards calls to console with `X-Free-Plan-Session: <mcp-session-id>` instead). Endpoint: `/mcp`

### Core Modules

- **`src/api.ts`** - GraphQL client for Graffiticode API. All language discovery and code generation is backend-driven. Defines `AuthContext`, the value threaded through every handler: `{ type: "firebase", token, source: "oauth" | "raw" }` or `{ type: "freePlan", sessionId }`. `buildAuthHeaders` turns the former into `Authorization: Bearer` and the latter into `X-Free-Plan-Session`. There is **no** `src/auth.ts` and no Firebase custom-token/ID-token exchange in this repo — `resolveBearer()` in `server.ts` classifies the incoming bearer and the console does the rest.
- **`src/events.ts`** - Structured funnel events (`mcp_connect`, `mcp_listed`, `mcp_resource`, `mcp_session_started`, `mcp_tool`) emitted as one JSON line per event to stdout → Cloud Logging, aggregated by the console's `scripts/mcp-funnel-report.ts` and its hourly digest (`console/src/lib/funnel-digest.ts`). `mcp_listed` (first `tools/list`-family request per session) and `mcp_resource` (a `resources/read`, logged only for our own `graffiticode://` namespace) are the stages between "a transport opened" and "someone asked for something" — without them a directory validator and an agent host that loaded the catalog and passed are the same event. All of these are emitted from ONE place: the `transport.onmessage` wrapper in `server.ts`, which the existing-session path reuses, so a single hook sees every message of a session. Every event also carries `tns`, the stable per-transport namespace: `session` becomes the console's workspace handle once a call adopts a workspace, so connect↔tool joins must key on `tns`. Instrumentation is best-effort and must never break a request. The privacy contract is load-bearing and asserted in the user-facing copy: never log raw prompts (only `desc_len`), never log raw session UUIDs or bearer tokens (only a one-way hash), never log the client IP (only coarse `CF-IPCountry` geo). The free-plan session hash reuses `deriveSessionNamespace` so the logged `session` joins to what the console stamps on items and claims.
- **`src/tools.ts`** - MCP tool definitions and handlers. Routes requests to backend based on language parameter.
- **`src/resources.ts`** - MCP resource handlers: per-language user guides, and **agent skills** discovered at request time from the public `graffiticode-skills` GitHub repo (each top-level dir = one skill `<id>/SKILL.md`, exposed as `graffiticode://skills/<id>`). Catalog is fetched via the GitHub contents API + raw content, cached ~60s (stale-while-revalidate). Adding a skill to that repo surfaces it with no rebuild/redeploy; nothing is vendored into this repo.
- **`src/oauth/`** - OAuth 2.1 + PKCE for hosted mode: dynamic client registration, authorize/callback/token endpoints, Firestore-backed store. Hosted auth accepts either an OAuth access token or a raw Graffiticode API key as the Bearer credential.
- **`src/widget/`** - A **native** inline widget that renders items *in the host sandbox* — no iframe. `toolsForClient()` (in `tools.ts`) wires the widget resource onto each widget-bearing tool's `_meta` (mimeType `text/html;profile=mcp-app`) on **two separate routes**, decided by `widgetRouteFor()`:
  - **`mcp-apps`** (Claude) — requires BOTH that the client declared `capabilities.extensions["io.modelcontextprotocol/ui"]` at `initialize` AND that its name matches `isWidgetHost()` = `/claude/i`. The declaration is load-bearing: `claude-code` matches the name but declares nothing, and was handed a widget it cannot mount — that is what rendered "Unable to reach Graffiticode" on every `render_item`. Emits nested `ui.resourceUri` + legacy `ui/resourceUri`.
  - **`openai`** (ChatGPT/Codex) — admitted by NAME only, `isOpenAIClient()` = `/openai|chatgpt|codex/i`, because ChatGPT does not declare the UI extension; it reads `openai/outputTemplate`, which the Apps SDK documents as a compatibility alias for `_meta.ui.resourceUri`. **Same resource, same bundles** — the keys differ, the artifact does not. Also sets `openai/toolInvocation/invoking`+`invoked`.
  - **`none`** — everyone else: no widget/UI `_meta`, no hydration `_meta`, no widget resource in `resources/list`; just the text summary plus its "Open in Graffiticode" link. Non-widget `_meta` (`securitySchemes`) is preserved on ALL routes.

  **This supersedes the earlier Claude-only whitelist**, under which ChatGPT was deliberately served no widget for app-directory submission. Serving OpenAI became safe once the widget stopped latching on the first result and sitting on "Loading…" forever (the "stuck Generating…" bug), and a native mount that draws nothing now falls back to the content card — the worst case is the card. **Caveat worth knowing:** `/openai|chatgpt|codex/i` is the same pattern that, as a blacklist, once MISSED ChatGPT's consumer app; as an allow-list that failure mode inverts into the consumer app silently getting no widget. 30 days of `mcp_connect` events show only `codex-mcp-client` / `openai-mcp` — no consumer ChatGPT name — so which way it falls is UNVERIFIED. Only `create_item`/`update_item` are non-widget-bearing (they return "generating"); `render_item`/`get_item` carry the widget marker. There is **no** `form_url` / token-bearing render URL, and no iframe.
  - **`browser/host.ts`** — the one seam: `HostAdapter` interface with `ExtAppsHost` (Claude, wraps the ext-apps `App` class: `ui/initialize` handshake, `ontoolresult`, theme, auto-resize) and `SkybridgeHost` (`window.openai`). `createHost()` feature-detects which to use, so one build serves both hosts. The Skybridge path IS now reachable in production via the `openai` route, but has not been confirmed rendering by a person.
  - **`browser/renderer.ts`** — the shared body: unwrap the tool result; for a natively-renderable language (see `languages.ts`) **dynamic-`import()` the per-language bundle from our own origin and `mount()` the component**; otherwise render a substantive content card (question list with correct answers marked / spec prose / data preview) with an "Open in Graffiticode" footer link. The widget deliberately carries **no refine/follow-up input**: it renders inside a chat, so a text box that only forwards to `host.sendMessage` duplicates the composer the user is already typing in — refinement is a plain chat turn that routes to `update_item`.
  - **`languages.ts`** — the registry of which languages get a native bundle. **Every language the catalog lists is in it** (11 as of 2026-09-01): each ships a React `Form` view, so a listed language with no entry silently degrades to the content card, which reads as a broken render rather than a deliberate one. This replaced a `NON_RENDERABLE_LANGUAGES` set that exempted `L0158/L0176/L0177/L0170` as unrenderable — wrong on the facts (each has a `Form` in its repo's `packages/view`), and imported nowhere, so it documented a policy the code never implemented. The props contract is uniform: `Form: ({ state })` from `@graffiticode/l0000-view` plus a `./style.css` subpath. Note the view package is `<lang>-view` where one exists — `@graffiticode/l0175` is the COMPILER and has no `Form`. **None of the 8 added 2026-09-01 has been seen rendering a real item by a person**; L0169 is the cautionary case, added on a clean build and then failing to mount in production.
  - **`scripts/build-widget.mjs`** bundles `browser/entry.ts` → `dist/widget/widget.bundle.js` (inlined into the HTML) and one ESM module per native language → `dist/widget/lang/<id>.mjs` (served over HTTP, React bundled in, uniform `mount(el,data)`/`styles` export). `browser/` is excluded from `tsc`. The generated per-language entry reproduces the non-networking half of l0000-view's `View`: **`state.apply` must be a React `useReducer` dispatch**, because every `Form` in the family is CONTROLLED (l0180 keeps the response in `state.data.response` and renders ✓/✗ + "Correct — 1 / 1 point" from it on the next render). An `apply` that only mutates a closure builds, mounts and draws — and then never selects or scores anything, which is how a scoring bug hid behind a passing build. `tests/widget-native-mount.test.ts` pins this by clicking a real L0180 payload in jsdom. What is still NOT reproduced: each package's language-specific reducer, and `View`'s `/compile` round trip — so a language whose feedback is computed upstream rather than in the browser stays inert (the CSP declares no `connectDomains`). L0180 ships its own scorer and is not one of those.
  - **CSP / cache** — the resource `_meta.ui.csp` declares **`resourceDomains` only** (the bundle origin); **no `frameDomains`** (the OpenAI review flag) and **no `connectDomains`** (formula/chart eval is client-side). The resource URI is **content-hashed** (`widgetResourceUris()`) because the host caches by URI — a stable URI makes the host replay a stale build. Per-language `.mjs` bundles are served from `handleRequest` with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (module scripts are always CORS-fetched from the opaque sandbox origin) and ETag revalidation.

### Implementation notes

- **Two independent stream keepalives, for two different failures.** The `CallTool` handler emits a protocol notification every 10s *during* a tool call, so a client's read timeout doesn't fire during a 60–110s generation. Separately, `startSseKeepalive` (`src/sse-keepalive.ts`, wired into both `/mcp` `handleRequest` call sites) writes an SSE comment every `SSE_KEEPALIVE_MS` into *any* open event stream — including the standalone `GET /mcp` notification stream, which carries no tool call, sends nothing on its own, and was therefore being cut by Cloudflare's 100s idle timeout (`524`). A comment is bytes on the wire but has no event id and no data, so it's invisible to the MCP layer and to stream resumability; the transport enqueues each event as one complete string, so a comment can only land between events, never inside one.
- **Conversation history.** `update_item` reads the item's `help` field (JSON array of prior user messages), builds a contextual prompt from the last 6 entries plus current `src`, calls `generateCode`, then appends a new entry and writes the updated array back. Iterative edits depend on this round-trip — don't drop the `help` write.
- **Language ID normalization.** Clients may pass `L0166` or `0166`; handlers strip the leading `L` before calling the API, and responses re-add it.
- **`create_item` flow.** Creates an empty item from the language template, then delegates to `handleUpdateItem` with the user's description — so template seeding and first-turn generation share one code path.
- **Item view links.** The native widget renders from the tool result's `data` and needs no render URL — there is no `form_url` and no token exchange. `view_url` (`${APP_URL}/form/<itemId>`, via `buildViewUrl`) is always set as the "Open in Graffiticode" secondary link; free-plan items also carry `claim_url`/`claim_message`.
- **`render_item` vs `get_item`.** `render_item` is the preferred user-facing retrieval: it waits for completion and returns a **compact** result (`item_id`, `status`, `language`, `name`, `view_url` (+ `claim_url`/`claim_message` on free-plan), summary) while isolating the language-private `src`/`data` needed to hydrate the Claude widget in `_meta.graffiticode` — hidden from the model transcript. The links are deliberately real fields, not just prose inside `summary`: non-widget clients (ChatGPT, Codex) have `_meta.graffiticode` stripped, so a link living only in the summary text would be the one thing they need and cannot address. `get_item` returns the raw `src`/`data`/metadata inline and is for programmatic clients only.

### MCP Tools (fixed set, language-agnostic)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `create_item(language, description)` | Create item in any language (async; returns `status: "generating"`) |
| `update_item(item_id, modification)` | Update item (language auto-detected; async) |
| `render_item(item_id)` | Preferred user-facing retrieval — waits for completion, returns a compact result, hydrates the Claude widget (keeps `src`/`data` out of the transcript) |
| `get_item(item_id)` | Retrieve RAW `src`/`data`/metadata for programmatic clients (long-polls to completion; prefer `render_item` for normal use) |
| `get_spec(item_id)` | Platform-neutral English spec — the only sanctioned cross-language bridge |
| `list_languages(domain?, search?)` | Discover available languages |
| `get_language_info(language)` | Get language docs, examples, React usage |

### User-facing docs

The privacy and terms pages exist **twice**: as hardcoded HTML template literals in
`src/server.ts` (`PRIVACY_HTML`, `TERMS_HTML`, `ABOUT_HTML` — these are what users
actually read at `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/about`) and as `PRIVACY.md` / `TERMS.md`.
**They are matched pairs — change both together.** They previously drifted: the
markdown gained a "Usage Analytics" section that the served page never got.

Anything asserted in the privacy copy must trace to real behavior: `src/events.ts`
for what is logged (metadata only; never the prompt, never the client IP) and
`src/oauth/firestore-store.ts` for what is persisted (OAuth records include the
user's email plus access/refresh tokens). Also keep the tool list in sync in three
places: `ABOUT_HTML`, `MCP_DISCOVERY`, and `README.md`.

### Environment Variables

- `GRAFFITICODE_CONSOLE_URL` - Console GraphQL API endpoint (default: `https://console.graffiticode.org/api`). Note this ends in `/api`.
- `GRAFFITICODE_CONSOLE_BASE_URL` - Console bare host used to build user-facing claim URLs (default: `https://console.graffiticode.org`).
- `GRAFFITICODE_API_URL` - Graffiticode API host. Serves language templates and backend code generation (default: `https://api.graffiticode.org`).
- `GRAFFITICODE_APP_URL` - App host used to build user-facing item view links (`/form/<id>`) (default: `https://app.graffiticode.org`).
- `GRAFFITICODE_AUTH_URL` - Auth endpoint (default: `https://auth.graffiticode.org`).
- `GRAFFITICODE_SKILLS_REPO` - Public GitHub repo (`owner/name`) discovered at request time to serve agent skills as MCP resources (default: `graffiticode/graffiticode-skills`).
- `GRAFFITICODE_SKILLS_REF` - Git ref/branch for skill discovery (default: `main`).
- `GRAFFITICODE_SKILLS_TTL_MS` - Skill catalog cache TTL in ms (default: `60000`).
- `FREE_PLAN_NAMESPACE_SALT` - Shared HS256 secret used to mint trial-claim JWTs. **Must be the identical value the console deploys with** — both come from the same Secret Manager entry populated by the console's `scripts/set-free-plan-secrets.sh`. Mount on Cloud Run with `gcloud run services update mcp-service --update-secrets=FREE_PLAN_NAMESPACE_SALT=FREE_PLAN_NAMESPACE_SALT:latest`. If unset, trial responses still succeed but omit `claim_url`/`claim_message` (single warning logged at startup).
- `OPENAI_APPS_CHALLENGE_TOKEN` - Token served **verbatim** (exact bytes, no JSON/prefix) as `text/plain` with `Cache-Control: no-store` at `/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge`, for OpenAI app-directory domain verification. OpenAI fetches it from the **root of the registered host** (`mcp.graffiticode.org`; the `/mcp` path is ignored). Set it on the **already-tested image** at submission time — `gcloud run services update mcp-service --update-env-vars=OPENAI_APPS_CHALLENGE_TOKEN=<token>` — then verify in the portal. The route **404s while unset**, so it's inert until submission. Pure seam in `src/challenge.ts`.
- `SSE_KEEPALIVE_MS` - How often to write an SSE comment into an open `/mcp` event stream, in ms (default: `30000`; `0` disables). Cloudflare cuts an idle streaming response at 100s, and a client's standalone `GET /mcp` notification stream is idle by nature — clients saw `StreamableHTTPError: Failed to open SSE stream … code: 524` and reconnect churn. See `src/sse-keepalive.ts`.
- `PORT` - HTTP server port (default: 3001).

### Trial-claim JWT (free-plan only)

Free-plan `create_item` and `update_item` responses include three extra fields so the user can transfer the item into a real Graffiticode account on first sign-in:

- `view_url` — `${APP_URL}/form/<id>`
- `claim_url` — `${CONSOLE_URL}/claim?token=<jwt>&src=chat&agent=<host>`
- `claim_message` — two lines: the URL, then a reconnect hint chosen for `<host>`

`src` attributes the click (chat link vs render-host footer). `agent` is the coarse
host bucket from `classifyClientHost` (`claude-code` | `claude-app` | `openai` |
`editor` | `unknown`) — never the raw `clientInfo.name` — so the claim page opens on
the right connect instructions instead of asking someone who just signed in to
identify their own agent. **This repo owns that taxonomy**; adding a bucket means
adding it here first, then teaching the console's `ConnectAgentInstructions`. It is
`agent=` and not `client=` because the console already reads `?client=` app-wide as
the item source surface (`console|mcp|front`).

The reconnect hint exists because a claimed user is still connected *anonymously* —
their next item lands back in a trial workspace. What fixes that differs by host:
`claude-code`/`editor` take an `Authorization` header, so they're pointed at the key
the claim page mints; `claude-app`/`openai` connector UIs have no header field, so
until `OAUTH_RECONNECT_ENABLED` is on they are told plainly that new items keep
starting out anonymous rather than sent at a sign-in that isn't offered yet.

The JWT contract (defined in `src/claim-token.ts` and verified by the console at `console/src/lib/claim-token.ts`):

- HS256, secret = `FREE_PLAN_NAMESPACE_SALT` (UTF-8 bytes)
- Audience: `graffiticode-claim`
- Expiry: 24h
- Payload: `{ sessionNamespace, sessionUuid }` where `sessionNamespace = sha256(salt + ":" + sessionUuid)`

The `sessionUuid` comes from the MCP transport's session id (set during the MCP `initialize` POST and read off the free-plan auth context as `auth.sessionId`).
